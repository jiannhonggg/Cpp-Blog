# Hello, I am Jian Hong,

Welcome to my digital garden, where I document my struggles, eureka moments and endless frustrations. I am currently on a mission to master **C++**, a language famous for its power and its unique ability to make developers question everything.

In a landscape where AI tools are often abused to skip fundamentals, I refuse to succumb. I believe that a great engineer must understand the system from the ground up and I am committed to mastering the "why".   

### A little about me : 
I am a Computer Science student at **Nanyang Technological Univeristy (NTU)**. My academic and technical interest lies in Machine Learning and C++ programming. When I’m not debugging memory leaks, I’m likely on the mats. I am a **Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu purple belt**. Much like jiujitsu, C++ is all about technique, leverage, and surviving uncomfortable positions, not forgetting the endless hours of studying.  

### Why C++ ?
In the world of programming, performance is king. I want to understand what's happening "under the hood" of the frameworks we use. Whether it's optimising kernels or managing memory manually, I believe that mastering C++ will make me a more precise and effective engineer.

### The goal of this blog:
This blog serves two purposes: 
1. **Accountability:** To ensure I am coding and learning every single day. 
2. **Reference:** To document solutions to the bugs and "Segmentation Faults" that I inevitably encounter so that others (and future me) can solve them faster. 

This is a raw, iterative record of my evolution as a programmer. I enjoy exploring a wide range of interest and would love to share my knowledge about them.

Welcome to my first official blog post! I am using this site to document everything I learn about **C++**. 

## Why C++?
I've decided to learn C++ because of its performance and its importance in systems programming. Here is the classic "Hello World" in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello, World! I am learning C++." << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```
